      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
         As a passionate and detail-oriented web developer, I specialize in building responsive and visually engaging websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy bringing creative ideas to life through clean code and intuitive user experiences. On the backend, I have hands-on experience working with PHP and MySQL to develop dynamic web applications that handle data efficiently. I also have a foundational understanding of Python, which strengthens my problem-solving and logical thinking. As a fresher, I’m eager to apply my technical skills to real-world projects, grow through continuous learning, and contribute meaningfully to a development team.

 <br><br>I believe in learning by doing and try to stay updated with the latest technologies and best practices. I’m currently focused on improving as a full-stack developer and looking forward to opportunities where I can learn, contribute, and grow.    </div>
